# Features

Below is an overview of the features provided by Missing Feature ACAP. 

---

#### Event Delay Timer

Introduces a configurable delay between the original event trigger and a subsequent action. This allows you to sequence events and automate workflows that depend on precise timing.

#### Event Sunrise and Sunset

Retrieves daily sunrise and sunset data and triggers corresponding events. Perfect for adjusting camera settings, turning on lights, or starting/stopping recordings according to natural light levels.

#### Event Countdown

Delivers a highly accurate on-screen timer with a stop-time latency under 50ms, ensuring precision for industrial applications. The countdown begins when a specified event occurs and stops either when another event is triggered or when the timer reaches zero. It can trigger events to capture images, send alerts, or start automated processes. Additionally, an optional on-screen overlay provides real-time monitoring, allowing you to customize the feature for your specific needs.

#### Event Timed Sequence

Triggers only if a second event follows the first within a defined time window. This feature helps in creating complex event chains, ensuring that actions are executed only under specific, timely conditions.

#### Image to SD Card

Automatically saves an image whenever a specified event occurs (for example, during motion detection). You can configure both the retention period and the maximum storage capacity (in GB) to suit your requirements. With built-in video generation, snapshots can be transformed into a timelapse sequence—ideal for long-term observation and quick playback of key events.

#### InfluxDB Push

Push various metrics to InfluxDB, like CPU, MEM, Proc stats, or any metadata event.

#### Parking Times

Logs the in and out timestamps of vehicles identified by the AXIS License Plate Verifier. This feature maintains a detailed record of parking durations and triggers an event if a vehicle exceeds the designated time. It enables timely notifications, enforcement actions, or other workflow automations.

#### Metadata to HTTPS

Sends metadata over HTTPS to a specified endpoint in real time. This facilitates seamless integration with cloud services, custom dashboards, or third-party applications, ensuring that critical data is securely and reliably delivered.
